The Infrastructure project contains the implementation details that interact with external resources such as the database and API endpoints. It is divided into:

The `Shared` project contains common components used across different layers of the application. It acts as a contract and utility layer between the Web, Core, and Infrastructure projects:

## Client

This project was generated using Angular CLI version 11.  
To run the frontend locally:

1. Navigate to the `client` folder:

cd client

2. Install dependencies:

npm install
3. Start the development server:

ng serve
The app will be served on `http://localhost:4200/` by default.

## NuGet Packages Used (Backend)

### ORM (Entity Framework Core)

`bash
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

Redis (Caching)

Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens
Install-Package System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
Used for implementing secure user authentication using JWT tokens and ASP.NET Core Identity.


Data Storage
Using SQL Server for all environments (development and production) to store products, orders, and related entities.

Using Redis to persist basket items in memory on the server.

Using Stripe for handling payment processing, with support for test and secure 3D transactions.

## Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK 8.0+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/) (to run the Angular frontend)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) (only if you want to test real webhook events)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedzakaria2003/fulstack_Ecommerce_dotnet_angular
cd Ecommerce_dotnet_angular

2. Configure Stripe

{
  "StripeSettings": {
    "PublishableKey": "pk_test_REPLACEME",
    "SecretKey": "sk_test_REPLACEME",
    "WhSecret": "whsec_REPLACEME"
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}

Run Stripe CLI and login:

stripe login


Start listening to webhook events and forward them to your local API:

stripe listen --forward-to https://localhost:5001/api/payments/webhook -e payment_intent.succeeded

3. Run the Backend (.NET)
cd API
dotnet restore
dotnet run

4. Run the Frontend (Angular)
cd client
npm install
ng serve


Stripe Testing
Use Stripe test card numbers to simulate payments.
Do not use real cards. This project is for educational/demo purposes only.
